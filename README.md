### Bricking Break

- My first game is a 2D brick-breaking game. The only reason I made it was to get experience.
- The game consists of a paddle controlled by mouse movement, a ball that we try not to let fall, and bricks that break when hit by the ball.
- In total, there are ten levels.
- With PlayerPrefs, I created a level locking system.
